    "## Problem Description\n",
    "In this lab, we'll learn about how to calculate and interpret Z-scores with the Normal and Standard Normal Distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "* Transform a normally distributed sample or population to the Standard Normal Distribution\n",
    "* Calculate and interpret the Z-score for a given value in a Standard Normal Distribution\n",
    "* Use Z-scores to make inferences about a normally distributed dataset\n",
    "* Use Cumulative Density functions to infer the probability mass of given samples\n",
    "\n",
    "### Z-Scores and The Normal Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "Z-scores are one of the main reasons the Normal Distribution is so useful.  Z-scores represent an easy way for us to quickly tell how many standard deviations a value is from the mean, which empowers us to quickly answer questions such as the probability of a specific value (_point probablility_), or the percentage of values in the dataset greater than or less than a given value (_cumulative probability_).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Take a look at the following diagram:\n",

    "### Interpreting a Z-Score\n",
    "\n",
    "Important things to note about the diagram above:\n",
    "\n",
    "* 100% of the data is found under the \"bell curve\" line.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The distribution is symmetrical.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* 99.7% of all data falls within 3 standard deviations of the mean.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Z-scores are just a measure of how many standard deviations away from the mean it is.  If a Z-score is positive, then we know it is greater than the mean, whereas values smaller than the mean will have a negative Z-score.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Since the distribution is symmetrical, we can also easily calculate the **_Cumulative Density_**.   We can use this to tell us what percentage of the population falls to the left or the right of a given value."
